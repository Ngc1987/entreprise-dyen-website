Typography: Use a classic and readable font (modifiable later based on the final identity).
User Experience:
Create an immersive and warm design with light animations and smooth transitions (e.g., hover effects, fade-ins/outs, gentle scaling).
Ensure smooth navigation with a sticky header that changes opacity or background upon scrolling.
Responsive Design:
Mobile-first approach with standard breakpoints:
sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px, xl: 1280px
Adapt layouts for large PC screens and tablets, optimizing element positioning.
Content and Pages:

Immersive Homepage:

A hero section with a full-width image overlaid with attention-grabbing text and an animated Call To Action (CTA).
Smooth transitions between sections to enhance immersion.
"Chalets" Page:

Present two sub-themes:
Wooden Chalets:
Image of a wooden chalet
Text describing the benefits (eco-friendly, architectural possibilities, energy efficiency, quick execution, administrative support)
Extensions:
Image of a home extension
Text outlining the benefits (lightweight, seamless integration, aesthetic appeal, simplified technical constraints)
On larger screens, consider a two-column layout side-by-side; on mobile, allow swipe navigation between themes.
"Carpentry / Interior Fittings" Page:

Present the service with an image and detailed text explaining interventions in exterior carpentry (wood, aluminum, PVC) and interior fittings.
Emphasize an immersive design even within a basic structure.
Gallery Page:

Display images as thumbnails.
On clicking an image, open a slider or modal in full view for an enriched visual experience.
Future iterations may explore a more creative layout.
Contacts Page:

Display an interactive map (Google Maps or similar) with complete contact details.
Include an illustrative image and, if needed, a contact form.
Interactions & Animations:

Implement smooth page transitions (e.g., fade-in/out or sliding effects) to maintain an immersive experience.
Use hover effects on buttons and images (gentle scaling, subtle shadows) to enhance interactivity.
For navigation, create a mobile menu with a hamburger icon that reveals links with animated transitions.
SEO & Performance Optimization:

Use static site generation (SSG) for all pages to optimize SEO and load times.
Optimize images using Next.jsâ€™ Image component.
Adhere to SEO best practices (meta tags, titles, descriptions, etc.)
